# Notebooks present in the repo

* ***URBE_Perception.ipynb***: this is the main notebook where I implemented most of the code for the project (*mandatory to read it*).
* ***data_processing.ipynb***: notebook in which there's the code for the creation of my custom *URBE Dataset*.
* ***Finetuning_YOLOv5.ipynb***: code where I *finetuned* my dataset on the official YOLOv5 models.

> I used ***WandB*** for logging my experiments: here it is the link to the workspace https://wandb.ai/lavallone/VISIOPE_project?workspace=user-lavallone.
